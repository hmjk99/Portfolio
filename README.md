For the overall design and structure, I got some ideas from Alexis Peves's example (did not know it was not his first project until I was already halfway into the project) and many youtube tutorials. 

Some videos I used as reference are the links below. Even though I referred to some videos, at first I did not look at the code they used in the tutorial, but just looked at the layout and tried to make it myself. After I finished a part, I watched the video to see how they worked it out. From the video, I saw they put some variables in css to reuse it and I thought it was a good idea and more efficient so I made my own variables to use throughout.
This actually made it easier when I was working on toggling dark mode. I made a carousel for the projects section, a modal for the contacts, and dark mode for my three points of interaction. I also added some content and changed layouts depending on the screen size and changed displays to show certain sections depending on the section the user clicks on the menu. 

I had a hard time with making a menu that pops up (maybe because that was the first part I worked on) because I was still struggling with positioning and sizing. But after finising this whole project, I am now more comfortable in working with css and definitely loving flex-box. Also, it was really interesting working on media queries (also a headache) because it really made me feel like a developer that was considering the users. I remember in one of the lectures, an insturctor said to work on mobile first and that was what I did. After trying it out, I feel like mobile first makes life easier because I think it is easier to re-organize the content in a bigger screen size than with a smaller screen.
